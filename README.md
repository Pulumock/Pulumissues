# Pulumissues

The [Dataset generator](./Source/Pulumock.Pulumissues.DatasetGenerator) extracts GitHub issues from selected repositories (currently [pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi) and [proti](https://github.com/proti-iac/proti)) and compiles them into a raw dataset that can be found under the [Datasets folder](./Datasets).
