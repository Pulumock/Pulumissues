# Pulumissues

This project contains the source code and datasets for analyzing testing-related Pulumi GitHub issues.

## Dataset generator

The [Dataset generator](./Source/Pulumock.Pulumissues.DatasetGenerator) extracts GitHub issues from selected repositories (currently [pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi), [pulumi-dotnet](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi-dotnet), and [proti](https://github.com/proti-iac/proti)) and compiles them into a raw dataset output to a specified path.

## Datasets

Previous raw and curated datasets can be found in the [Datasets folder](./Datasets).
